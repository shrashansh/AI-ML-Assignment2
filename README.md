AI ML Assignment 2 for OpenInApp Internship

The code has used open-source tortoise-tts which allows us to clone voices, the results are not much accurate due to low GPU at my end.
firstly I've extracted the text from speech using speech recognition tool and then translated the output using googletranslator.
I've also trained the model with Narendra Modi's previous speech which were particularly in english for now, due to low GPU storage and short span of time, for accurate response a model needs to be trained for around 50+ hours, here I've tried to train the model with short 10 second speeches in the .wav format. 
I've also tried to extend the speech as much as possible, but it was not possible to extend it for 1 minute due to high GPU requirement, and the processing was very slow for this output too.
The model can be trained if high system requirements are fulfiled in the future.


thanks.
